This App uses data from the UK Government's DUKES (Digest of UK Energy Statistics) dataset on fuel poverty and domestic energy consumption. It uses the Low Income High Cost measure which started to be measured in 2011. 

Select a Local authority from the drop down list to see the changes in fuel poverty within that area which will be displayed as a bar chart in the Annual Change Tab.  The national rate is depicted as a point above each bar plot.

Select a year to see detailed statistics of the selected local authority in the Detailed Statistics tab including a breakdown of the energy consumed and the mean annual energy consumption.
